# Loan Approval Prediction and EMI Management App

## Overview

Welcome to the **Loan Approval Prediction and EMI Management App**! This application leverages machine learning to predict loan approval eligibility and calculate the **Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)** for a loan request. By analyzing key factors such as the applicant's education, income, CIBIL score, loan amount, term, and assets value, the app determines the likelihood of loan approval and helps users calculate their monthly payments.

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements

To run this app, you'll need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `joblib`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them via pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy joblib matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Setting Up the Model

- **Model**: The app uses a trained RandomForest model saved as `best_rf_model.pkl` (or any name you choose, as long as it matches the file name).
- **Scaler**: A `StandardScaler` is used for scaling the input features and should be saved as `Scaler.pkl`.

Save the models and scaler using `joblib`:

```python
import joblib

# Saving the model
joblib.dump(model, 'best_rf_model.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'Scaler.pkl')
```

---

### Running the App

1. Clone the repository or place the `loan_app.py` file in your working directory.
2. Ensure the model (`best_rf_model.pkl`) and scaler (`Scaler.pkl`) files are in the same directory.
3. Run the app using **Streamlit**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run loan_app.py
   ```

   The app will start on a local server, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Model Explanation

The **RandomForestClassifier** model has been trained on a dataset that includes the following features:

- **Number of Dependents**: Number of dependents the applicant has.
- **Education**: Whether the applicant is a graduate or not.
- **Self Employed**: Whether the applicant is self-employed.
- **Annual Income**: The total income of the applicant in a year.
- **Loan Amount**: The requested loan amount.
- **Loan Term**: The duration of the loan in years.
- **CIBIL Score**: The applicant's credit score.
- **Assets Value**: The total value of assets owned by the applicant.

The model predicts the likelihood of loan approval or rejection based on these factors.

## How to Use the App

### 1. **Input Applicant Details**:
   - Enter the applicant's **number of dependents**, **education**, **self-employment status**, **annual income**, **loan amount**, **loan term**, **CIBIL score**, and **assets value** in the sidebar.

### 2. **Predict Loan Approval**:
   - After entering the details, click on the "Predict Loan Approval" button to get the loan approval status and the model's prediction confidence.

### 3. **EMI Calculation**:
   - Once the loan is approved, the app will also calculate the EMI based on the provided loan amount, rate of interest, and loan term.

### 4. **Eligibility Suggestions**:
   - The app will provide suggestions on improving eligibility for the loan based on the input details (e.g., improving CIBIL score, reducing loan amount).

### 5. **Visualization**:
   - The app displays a graphical representation of the EMI breakdown, showing the principal and interest components.

## Example Use Case

**Input**:

- Number of Dependents: 2
- Education: Graduate
- Self Employed: No
- Annual Income: â‚¹500,000
- Loan Amount: â‚¹300,000
- Loan Term: 10 years
- CIBIL Score: 750
- Assets Value: â‚¹2,000,000

**Output**:

- Loan Approval: Approved
- Loan Approval Probability: 85%
- EMI: â‚¹3,400 per month
- Suggestions: "ðŸ“ˆ Reduce loan amount for better approval chances."

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

- If the applicantâ€™s CIBIL score is below 650, the app will suggest improving their score by clearing debts and making timely payments.
- If the loan amount requested is too high compared to annual income, the app will recommend reducing the amount for better eligibility.
